It is a practical way to notice thoughts, physical sensations, sight, smell, sounds, anything that would not come into our notice otherwise. In simple words, it is choosing and learning to control our focus of attention."

        "1. Mindfulness of something: There has to be something to be mindful about. Your breathing, steps and some other areas of the body can usually be a point of focus. Concentration and Mindfulness work hand in hand. concentration, on one hand, is focusing on a single point of contact while practising mindfulness on the other is to develop your power of concentration along with developing your power of being Mindful. One cannot separate Mindfulness and Concentration.",
        "2. Mindfulness of something in the present moment: The point of focus of Mindfulness is always in the present, it does not focus on the past or future but it doesn’t necessarily have to be something existing in the physical world. If your attention is not on something which exists in the present moment, you are not being mindful as you are making a conscious decision of focusing on your past, future or some other imaginable moment.                                               Often people think of Mindfulness as simply just observing things on a surface level. You might think you’re observing the surrounding, but in reality, you are observing your perception of those things. Mindfulness is going beyond that overt observation and internalizing what you have observed so that you can overcome your wrong perceptions and get to the reality with no filters.",
        "3. A conscious decision: Mindfulness is directing your consciousness to the present, for a purpose. It is like an anchor point to the present moment. Imagine mindfulness as a ship and yourself as a Captain. You will consciously decide, where to place the anchor. Next, you throw the anchor, i.e. your concentration, off the ship. The anchor then reaches the intended anchor point, where it will rest. Initially, the anchor will not be strong but eventually, it will become tough and resilient enough.",
        "4. Nonjudgmental awareness: Mindfulness accepts everything around our vision in its original form and this is the utmost purpose of mindfulness. True peace and happiness can be found from mindfulness because it is completely non-judgmental. It just requires you to be mindful of all the things that you observe and expects you to make no distinctions, hold no bias and is free of the mental filters that distort our perception of what is real. It enables us to experience true reality liberally.",
        "5. Developed with time: In the beginning, your mindfulness energy will be weak but over time your mindfulness will become strong and you’ll be able to differentiate between your ability to concentrate and the ability to see things with Mindfulness. It will take practice to master the “art of being Mindful” and trying to fit the practice of mindfulness in your life will conflict with your existing habits. It’s called “Habit energy” in Buddhism. Each activity we do has a certain energy and the more you do something the more energy it builds.",
        "6. Enabling the HD mode in your life: Once people develop the “Art of Mindfulness”, it feels as if one has enabled the High Definition mode of life. When you make the conscious decision of being Mindful is when you wake up from your half-awakened state. It will lead you to notice things that remained unnoticed before and it will magnify details of life.                Mindfulness is a single thing, it is non-judgmental, Point of focus is in the present, the decision of being aware in the present reality is conscious. This enables us to look at the world with novelty and it is beyond our incorrect perceptions, existing notions, deep-seated emotions, and beyond the ego. Seeing reality with purity and without any filter with unlimited joy and happiness."

        "c) Once sitting comfortably, you can now relax and take a few deep breaths and allow yourself to adjust to that new position. d) Your neck and back should be straight and stomach should be relaxed at the same time. A correct posture ensures correct meditation with correct breathing and concentration.",
        "e) Place the fingers of your one hand over the fingers of the other and simultaneously touch the tips of your thumbs, making an oval shape. The logic behind sitting in cosmic mudra has a meaning but in short, it helps you bring your mind, body and breath together.",
        "f) Begin with looking down and allow your eyelids to drop naturally. Keeping your eyes half-closed prevents inviting lethargy and a sleepy state of mind and it also prevents blinking often."

        "a) Close your mouth and inhale followed by exhaling. Simply observe the act that we do 24/7, focus on the breath that goes in and goes out. Do not try to restrict or exert yourself through deep breathing. Just breathe normally and direct your concentration towards it. Initially, you might find it difficult to concentrate but to keep the focus solely on breathing should be the primary goal.",
        "b) Count each breath that goes in as one and each breath that goes out till two. Count till 10 and if you get distracted in the middle then simply start over your counting from one. Repeat this for a few months till it this task becomes effortless.",
        "c) Thoughts are automatic and one cannot put complete control on them. You can try to change your thoughts but you cannot put a full stop to it. For that matter, even to change a particular thought, you need to give attention to those thoughts which merely means to acknowledge them. Our mind is a wanderer and it is bound to get distracted as in such a fast-paced life we do not involve ourselves to remove time for self and thus when we sit to be mindful, we will have a million thoughts running over our head. The task is not to ignore or filter any thoughts but to simply acknowledge it, notice it and let it pass.",
        "d) Let the thought come, greet it and let it go. Request your mind to get back to its original business of focusing on breathing. This will be a task and will be frustrating until you practice it. Your mind will be the best guide and will do what it is supposed to once it learns to drift from your thoughts to your breathing."
